./pytorch-yolo2
    
    ./backup
        stores the weights of the model currently being run by train.py

    ./bbox-label-tool
        the labeling tool

        important files:
            main.py (can't be run remotely, I think)

            Labels/convert_labels.py
            Labels/renumber.py
            Labels/count_monopoles.py

            Images/

    ./weights
        stores the weights of some successful runs

    ./cfg
        stores the .cfg file for the model, which dictates the model architecture
        also stores the .data which holds the class information
        
        important files:
            monopoles.cfg
            monopoles.data 

    ./data
        holds the images and labels for the datasets

        important files:
            images/
            labels/

    ./predictions
        the results of inferencing. These contain images that the model predicts contains monopoles

    important files:

        detect.py
            for inferencing. Give it a directory full of images to predict on and it will place
            its predictions for in predictions
        train.py


./monopole-detection
    
    important files:
        utils/scrape_images.py
            this is how we collect new images of cities. It puts its results in scraped_images
            I have been collecting 40k images from a city at a time

./scraped_images
    contains the scraped images of cities using Google maps
